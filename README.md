# New York City Parks Safety Analysis

Welcome to the New York City Parks Safety Analysis project! This analysis focuses on crime incidents occurring at New York City (NYC) parks and aims to advocate for safer parks. The project was undertaken in collaboration with a community forum to design an attention-grabbing visualization that supports their efforts in lobbying for increased police patrols in NYC public parks.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis was to analyze crime incidents reported to the New York Police Department (NYPD) during the first quarter of 2018 at NYC parks, excluding Central Park. The results are displayed on a map, incorporating the actual park layouts and sizes. The visualization incorporates tooltips and filtering options per borough to enhance user engagement.

The data was extracted, converted, and processed to create a structured dataset suitable for analysis. The dataset includes information on the nature of the crimes, locations within the parks, and relevant timestamps.
